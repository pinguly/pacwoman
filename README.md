# Pacwoman

Authors: Nicolas Faroß, Yvonne Neuy

## About

The game Pacwoman is a tribute to the 1980 game Pac-Man by Namco and was developed for the *EXHIBITION: Women & Mathematics* at Saarland University on November 3, 2023. However, in contrast to the original game, it is played on a general translation surface: 
the edges of the playing field are glued together in pairs. If you cross an edge, you come out via the corresponding partner edge 
at another point in the playing field.

## Online Version

The game can be played online at <https://pinguly.github.io/pacwoman/>.
At the beginning or after a game over, a level can be selected. After confirming the selection, the game starts and Pacwoman can be navigated through the maze. The controls are given by following the keys:

* Change level: *Left*, *Right* arrow key or *A*, *D*
* Start current level: *Enter* or *Space*
* Change direction: *Arrow keys* or *W*, *A*, *S*, *W*
* Abort current level: *Escape* or *Backspace*
* Enter full-screen: *Double click*

## Mathematical Background

Since its beginnings in the 1980s, the *theory of translational surfaces* has developed into an important and active mathematical field. A central question is for example: What does the path of a point traveling in a straight line on a translational surface at constant speed look like? How often does the path close? How often does it spread out densely on the translation surface?

This field of research combines topics from different mathematical subfields such as *algebraic geometry*, *geometric group theory*, *number theory* and the theory of *dynamical systems* in a fascinating way. Leading mathematicians have contributed with numerous results, including the six Fields Medalists between 1994 and 2014. Nevertheless, there are still many unsolved problems that mathematicians from all over the world, including [Prof. Gabriela Weitze-Schmithüsen](https://www.math.uni-sb.de/ag/weitze/index.php/de/personen/weitze-schmithuesen)'s research group at Saarland University, are intensively researching.
